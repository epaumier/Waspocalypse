# Waspocalypse
I created this game with HTML5, CSS &amp; Javascript as part as a challenge in a recruitment process

Go checkout this quirky project: http://paumier-edouard.com/Waspocalypse/

## The Assignment

The objective of this exercise is to create a frontend application that performs the following tasks:

* A button must be present to kick off the process of hitting a random wasp.
* All code must be submitted to work in a local environment.
* The game must adhere to specification.
* The game logic should be implemented in using the following technologies:
  * HTML
  * SASS / SCSS
  *  When writing CSS, you may follow ANY class naming convention and structure that you wish, but there must be a convention that’s adhered to
  *  Vanilla JavaScript only

### Specification:

1/ Queen Wasp:
The Queen Wasp has a lifespan of 100 Hit Points. When the Queen Wasp is hit, 8 Hit Points are deducted from her lifespan. If/When the Queen Wasp has run out of Hit Points, All remaining alive Wasps automatically run out of hit points. There is only 1 Queen Wasp.

2/ Worker Wasp:
Worker Wasps have a lifespan of 75 Hit Points. When a Worker Wasp is hit, 10 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan. There are 5 Worker Wasps.

3/ Drone Wasp:
Drone Wasps have a lifespan of 50 Hit Points. When a Drone Wasp is hit, 12 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan. There are 8 Drone Wasps.

* Gameplay:
    * To play, there must be a button that enables a user to “hit” a random wasp.
    * The selection of a wasp must be random.
    * When the wasps are all dead, the game must be able to reset itself with full life wasps for another round.

### Constraints:
* The application must run through a browser only, no server side code / solutions are allowed.
